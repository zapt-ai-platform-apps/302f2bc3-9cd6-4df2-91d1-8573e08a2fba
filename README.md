# Wooordle

Wooordle is a web-based word guessing game inspired by Wordle, now featuring a dark theme for a sleek, modern look. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the tiles will change color to show how close your guess was to the actual word. The on-screen keyboard also updates to show which letters have been used and their status.
