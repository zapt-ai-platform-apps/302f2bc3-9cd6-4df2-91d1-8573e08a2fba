## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**

   - Open the app to begin playing Wooordle.

2. **Enter Your Guess**

   - Use your **physical keyboard** or the **on-screen keyboard** to input letters and form a five-letter word.
   - Your current guess will appear on the game board **immediately as you type**.

3. **Submit Your Guess**

   - Press the **"Enter"** key on your keyboard or on the on-screen keyboard to submit your guess.

4. **Feedback on Your Guess**

   - After submitting, each letter in your guess will change color:
     - **Green**: The letter is in the correct position.
     - **Yellow**: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
     - **Gray**: The letter is not in the word at all.
   - The **on-screen keyboard** will also update:
     - **Green Key**: The letter is in the correct position in one of your guesses.
     - **Yellow Key**: The letter is in the word but not yet in the correct position.
     - **Gray Key**: The letter is not in the word at all.

5. **Duplicate Letters Handling**

   - If your guess contains duplicate letters and the target word has fewer instances of that letter, the game correctly marks the extra letters as gray (absent). This means the feedback accurately reflects the number of times a letter appears in the actual word.

6. **Continue Guessing**

   - You have up to six attempts to guess the correct word.
   - Use the feedback from previous guesses and the keyboard colors to inform your next guess.

7. **Win or Lose**

   - **Win**: If you guess the correct word within six tries, a success message will appear.
   - **Lose**: If you fail to guess the word after six attempts, the correct word will be revealed.

8. **Play Again**

   - After completing a game, you can start a new game by clicking the **"Play Again"** button.
